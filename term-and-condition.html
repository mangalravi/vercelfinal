        <p><strong>Claim process for Heavy &amp; Bulky units</strong></p>
        <p>Inventory offered through Amazon partners will be on ‘As Is’ basis. H&amp;B inventory has to be picked by buyer directly from Amazon warehouse. Amazon team will load the inventory in the vehicle organized by the Buyer and seal the truck. Buyer should check the seal and take image of the same if it is broken. Buyer can raise claims for missing fake and mismatch items except in case of Air conditioners where no claim will be entertained for mismatch cases of Indoor and outdoor units.</p>
        <p>All shipments received by the buyer have to be unloaded and opened under a clear video recording right from breaking of the Amazon seal put on the truck . At that time the buyer has to show under the camera that items are missing or fake. If the box is opened without video recording and video is taken later where original seal on the box is already tampered then no claims will be entertained. For mismatch items along with the video recording need photograph from all six sides of the mismatch items. Amazon will verify and process the claims as per its internal policies, this may take up to three weeks for closure. In exceptional cases it can take even longer. Written communication will be shared by Blubirch on the claim decision taken by Amazon. If claim is approved the payment will be processed to buyer.</p>
        <p>Following points to be ensured while claiming for Heavy and Bulky units.</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Vehicle Open Video – You must open the seal of the vehicle under camera clearly and unload all the units without any cuts in video.</li>
           <li>Unboxing Video of Units – Unbox all the units under camera clearly.</li>
           <li>Six side photos – Please take images from six sides for mismatch units. Please note different outdoor and Indoor units in an Air conditioner won’t be considered as mismatch and no claims will be entertained for such cases.</li>
